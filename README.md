# Object-Oriented-Programming-with-Java_II


This is the second part of University of Helsinkiâ€™s free massive open online course (MOOC) on programming.

I learned and practiced the concepts of Inheritance, Polymorphism, lambda expressions and some other useful techniques like regular expressions, enumerate type and iterator.
